If the user's guess is greater than a random number, the program should print the message 'Too much, try again'. If the guess is less than a random number, the program should display the message 'Too little, try again'.

# Word Guessing 	(Russian answers)

Project description: The program guesses a word and the user has to guess it. Initially, all the letters of the word are unknown. A gallows with a noose is also drawn. The user suggests a letter that can be part of the word. If there is such a letter in the word, the program puts the letter as many times as it occurs in the word. If there is no such letter, a circle in the loop representing the head is added to the hangman. The user keeps guessing the letters until he guesses the whole word. For each unsuccessful attempt, another part of the hangman's torso is added (usually there are 6: head, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs.
